            <div style="text-align: center"><p>On November 19, 2022, the country went to the polls for the 15th General Election. Because of this, I decided to offer my services as a volunteer to the SPR officer who is in charge of this PRU.  <br>
              At that time, I was working as a guide, and one of my responsibilities was to demonstrate to voters where they should cast their ballots. <br>
              The fact that there are so many various kinds of individuals makes it both incredibly exhausting and quite enjoyable. <br>
              In addition, in order to be a GE officer, one needs to have trust, and they are not allowed to leave their job station at will. Work duties were assigned to me at SMK Melawati.</p></div>
